## 💿 Features

This Stack has been created with two main purposes: **simplicity** and **solidity**. Aiming for those who loves to build their stuff from the ground, with a solid, testing-ready template, to start coding right away.

- [Fly app Deployment](https://fly.io) with [Docker.](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Database ORM with [Prisma.](https://www.prisma.io/)
- Production-Ready with [PostgreSQL Database](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for Deploy on merge to Production and Staging environments.
- Healthcheck Endpoint for [Fly backups Region Fallbacks.](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/#services-http_checks)
- Styling with [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [Tailwind Prettier-Plugin.](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)
- End-to-End testing with [Cypress.](https://www.cypress.io/how-it-works)
- Unit Testing with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) and [Testing Library.](https://testing-library.com)
- Local third party request mocking with [MSW.](https://mswjs.io)
- Linting with [ESLint.](https://eslint.org/)
- Code formatting with [Prettier.](https://prettier.io/)
- Static Types with [TypeScript.](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Support for Javascript developers with continuous updates over time based on `remix.init`.

### We've got a 🐳 [SQLite](https://github.com/dev-xo/barebones-stack) version also.

Would you like to change something? Fork it, change it and use `npx create-remix@latest --template your/repo`!<br/>
Learn more about [Remix Stacks](https://remix.run/stacks).

## 🔋 Quickstart

To get started, run the following commands in your console:

```sh
# Initializes template in your workspace:
npx create-remix@latest --template dev-xo/barebones-postgres-stack

# Setups database: (Choose between the following 2 options)
npm run docker || 'Manually set your Postgres database keys into the .env file.'
```

> **Note:** The npm script will complete while Docker sets up the container in the background. Ensure that Docker has finished and your container is running before proceeding.

```sh
# Seeds your database:
npm run setup

# Builds your server:
npm run build

# Starts dev server:
npm run dev
```

> Note: Cloning the repository instead of initializing it with the above commands, will result in a inappropriate experience. This template uses `remix.init` to configure itself and prepare your environment.

## 🚀 Deployment

This Remix Stack comes with two GitHub Actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production and staging environments. Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

1. [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)
2. Sign up and Log in to Fly:

```sh
fly auth signup
```

3. Create two apps on Fly, one for staging and one for production:

```sh
fly apps create barebones-postgres-stack
fly apps create barebones-postgres-stack-staging
```

> Make sure this name matches the `app` set in your `fly.toml` file. Otherwise, you will not be able to deploy.

4. Initialize Git:

```sh
git init --initial-branch=main
```

5. Create a new [GitHub Repository](https://repo.new), and then add it as the remote for your project. **Do not push your app yet!**

```sh
git remote add origin <ORIGIN_URL>
```

6. Add a `FLY_API_TOKEN` to your GitHub repo. To do this, go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`.
7. Add a `SESSION_SECRET` to your fly app secrets, to do this you can run the following commands:

```sh
fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app barebones-postgres-stack
fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app barebones-postgres-stack-staging
```

> **Note:** If you don't have openssl installed, you can also use [1password](https://1password.com/password-generator/) to generate a random secret, just replace `$(openssl rand -hex 32)` with the generated secret.

8. Create a database for both your staging and production environments. Run the following:

```sh
fly postgres create --name barebones-postgres-stack-db
fly postgres attach barebones-postgres-stack-db

fly postgres create --name barebones-postgres-stack-staging-db
fly postgres attach barebones-postgres-stack-staging-db
```

> Fly will take care of setting the `DATABASE_URL` secret for you.

9. Now that everything is set up you can **commit and push** your changes to your repo.

> Every commit to your `main` branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment, and every commit to your `dev` branch will trigger a deployment to your staging environment.

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.<br/><br/>
Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests / build / etc.<br/>
Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## 🧩 Testing

### Cypress

We use Cypress for our End-to-End tests in this project. You'll find those in the `cypress` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create a new file in the `cypress/e2e` directory to test your changes.

We use [`@testing-library/cypress`](https://testing-library.com/cypress) for selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test:e2e:dev` which will start the dev server for the app as well as the Cypress client. Make sure the database is running in docker as described above.

### Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`. We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test` or `npm run test:cov` to get a detailed summary of your tests.

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.

This template has pre-configured prettier settings on `.package-json`. Feel free to update each value with your preferred work style.
